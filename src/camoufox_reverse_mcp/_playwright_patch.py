"""
Startup patch for a Playwright Firefox-driver crash (issue #5).

Some Playwright builds serialize an uncaught page error by reading
``pageError.location.url`` / ``.lineNumber`` / ``.columnNumber`` without a
null check. When a page throws an uncaught error whose ``location`` is
``undefined`` (observed on sites such as arcteryx.com and rei.com), the
Node.js driver process crashes with::

    TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'url')

and the Python side only sees ``Connection closed while reading from the
driver``. This is a bug inside the bundled Playwright driver — not in this
project nor in Camoufox — and it cannot be caught from Python because the
crash happens in the driver process before the event reaches us.

We fix it at startup by adding optional chaining + defaults. The patch is
deliberately conservative:

* It scans every ``*.js`` under the installed Playwright driver (covers both
  the bundled ``coreBundle.js`` layout used by older builds and the
  split-file layout used by newer ones).
* It only rewrites the exact buggy tokens (``pageError.location.url`` etc.),
  which appear *only* in the vulnerable serialization path — so substring
  replacement cannot touch unrelated code.
* It is a no-op on versions that don't contain those tokens (e.g. Playwright
  >= 1.52 removed the ``location`` field entirely).
* It is idempotent (re-running finds nothing to change).
* It never raises: any failure only prints a warning to stderr and startup
  continues normally.
